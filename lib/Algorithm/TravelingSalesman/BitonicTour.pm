Algorithm::TravelingSalesman::BitonicTour - solve the euclidean traveling-salesman problem with bitonic tours

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Algorithm::TravelingSalesman::BitonicTour;

    my $b = Algorithm::TravelingSalesman::BitonicTour->new;
    $b->add_point($x1,$y2);
    $b->add_point($x2,$y2);
    # ...add other points as needed...
    # get and print the solution
    my $solution = $b->solve;
    print $solution->distance;
    print join q( => ), $solution->points;

=head1 THE PROBLEM

From I<Introduction to Algorithms>, 2nd ed., T. H. Cormen, C. E. Leiserson, R.
Rivest, and C. Stein, MIT Press, 2001, problem 15-1, p. 364:

=over 4

The B<euclidean traveling-salesman problem> is the problem of determining the
shortest closed tour that connects a given set of I<n> points in the plane.
Figure 15.9(a) shows the solution to a 7-point problem.  The general problem is
NP-complete, and its solution is therefore believed to require more than
polynomial time (see Chapter 34).

J. L. Bentley has suggested[2] that we simplify the problem by restricting our
attention to B<bitonic tours>, that is, tours that start at the leftmost point,
go strictly left to right to the rightmost point, and then go strictly right to
left back to the starting point.  Figure 15.9(b) shows the shortest bitonic
tour of the same 7 points.  In this case, a polynomial-time algorithm is
possible.

Describe an I<O>(n^2)-time algorithm for determining an optimal bitonic tour.
You may assume that no two points have the same I<x>-coordinate.  (I<Hint:>
Scan left to right, maintaining optimal possibilities for the two parts of the
tour.)

From wikipedia:

=over 4

In computational geometry, a I<bitonic tour> of a set of point sites in the
Euclidean plane is a closed polygonal chain that has each site as one of its
vertices, such that any vertical line crosses the chain at most twice.

=head2 Insight #1

B<The cost structure stores the cost of (i.e. length of) a specific path>.

=over 4

C<cost(i,j)> = the cost of a B<partial bitonic tour> from point C<i> through the leftmost
point to point C<j>.  The fact that this is a bitonic tour implies:

  * all points to the left of C<j> are included in tour(i,j)

=back

=head2 Insight #2



=head2 Recurrence


    Why will they let us assume that no two x-coordinates are the same? What
    does the hint mean? What happens if I scan from left to right?

    If we scan from left to right, we get an open tour which uses all points to
    the left of our scan line.  

    In the optimal tour, the kth point is connected to exactly one point to the
    left of k (k != n).   Once I decide which point that is, say x. I need the optimal
    partial tour where the two endpoints are x and k-1, because if it isn't
    optimal I could come up with a better one.

    Hey, I have got a recurrence! And look, the two parameters which describe
    my optimal tour are the two endpoints.

    Let c[k,n] be the optimal cost partial tour where the two endpoints are k<n.

        c[k,n]   <= c[k,n-1] + d[n,n-1]   , when k < n-1
        c[n-1,n] <= c[k,n-1] + d[k,n]     , when k < n-1

    c[0,1] = d[0,1] 

    c[n-1, n] takes O(n) to update, c[k, n] k<n-1 takes O(1) to update. Total
    time is O(n^2).

    But this doesn't quite give the tour, but just an open tour. We simply must
    figure where the last edge to n must go. 

        Tour Cost = min[k=1..n]{ c[k,n] + d[k,n] }

===============

    A[i,j] = A[i,j-1] + d(j-1,j)                 if j >= i+2
    A[i,j] = min[ k < i ] { A[k,i] + d(k,j) }    if j  = i+1




=head1 THIS SOLUTION'S FLAWS


=head1 METHODS

=head2 Algorithm::TravelingSalesman::BitonicTour->new()

Constructs a new C<Algorithm::TravelingSalesman::BitonicTour> solution object.

Example:

    my $ts = Algorithm::TravelingSalesman::BitonicTour->new;

=cut

sub new {
    my $class = shift;
    my %new = (
        _tour   => {},
        _points => {},
    );
    my $self = bless \%new, $class;
    return $self;
}

=head2 $ts->add_point($x,$y)

Adds a point at position (C<$x>, C<$y>) to be included in the solution.  Method
C<add_point()> checks to make sure that no two points have the same
I<x>-coordinate.  This method will C<croak()> with a descriptive error message
if anything goes wrong.

Example:

    # add point at coordinates (x=2, y=3) to the tour
    $ts->add_point(2,3);

=cut

sub add_point {
    my $self = shift;
    my $valid = { type => SCALAR, regexp => $RE{num}{real} };
    my ($x, $y) = validate_pos(@_, ($valid) x 2);
    if (exists $self->_points->{$x}) {
        my $py = $self->_points->{$x};
        croak "FAIL: point ($x,$y) duplicates previous point ($x,$py)";
    }
    else {
        $self->_sorted_points(undef);   # clear any previous cache of sorted points
        $self->_points->{$x} = $y;
        return [$x, $y];
    }
}

=head2 $ts->N()

Returns the number of points that have been added to the object.

Example:

    print "I have %d points.\n", $ts->N;

=cut

sub N {
    my $self = shift;
    return scalar keys %{ $self->_points };
}

=head2 $ts->R()

Returns the index of the rightmost point that has been added to the object.
This is always one less than C<< $ts->N >>.

=cut

sub R {
    my $self = shift;
    die 'Problem has no rightmost point (N < 1)' if $self->N < 1;
    return $self->N - 1;
}


=head2 $ts->sorted_points()

Returns an array of points sorted by increasing I<x>-coordinate.  The first
array element is thus the leftmost point in the problem.

Each point is represented as an arrayref containing 2 elements.  The sorted
array of points is cached, but the cache is cleared by each call to
C<add_point()>.

Example:

    my $ts = Algorithm::TravelingSalesman::BitonicTour->new;
    $ts->add_point(1,1);
    $ts->add_point(0,0);
    $ts->add_point(2,0);
    my @sorted = $ts->sorted_points;    # an array of three points

=cut

sub sorted_points {
    my $self = shift;
    unless ($self->_sorted_points) {
        my @x = sort { $a <=> $b } keys %{ $self->_points };
        my @p = map [ $_, $self->_points->{$_} ], @x;
        $self->_sorted_points(\@p);
    }
    return @{ $self->_sorted_points };
}

=head2 coord($n)

Returns an array containing the coordinates of point C<$n>.

Examples:

    my ($x0, $y0) = $ts->coord(0);   # coordinates of leftmost point
    my ($x1, $y1) = $ts->coord(1);   # coordinates of next point
    # ...
    my ($xn, $yn) = $ts->coord(-1);  # coordinates of rightmost point

=cut

sub coord {
    my ($self, $n) = @_;
    return @{ ($self->sorted_points)[$n] };
}

=head2 $ts->solve()

Solves the problem as configured.  See L</"THE SOLUTION"> above for algorithm
details.

Returns a number equal to the length of the minimum tour.

Example:

    my $tour_length = $ts->solve();

=cut

sub solve {
    my $self = shift;
    my ($length, @points);
    if ($self->N < 1) {
        croak "FAIL: you need to add some points!";
    }
    elsif ($self->N == 1) {
        $length = 0;
    }
    else {
        ($length, @points) = $self->optimal_full_tour;
    }
    return ($length, @points);
}

=head2 $ts->optimal_full_tour

Find the length of the optimal complete bitonic tour by finding the minimum
value of

=over 4

min{ i = 0 ..  }( cost(i,N) + delta(i,N) )

=back

=cut

sub optimal_full_tour {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->populate_partial_tours;
    my $R = $self->R;
    my @tours = map {
        my $cost = $self->tour_cost($_,$self->R) + $self->delta($_,$self->R);
        my @points = ($self->tour_points($_,$R), $_);
        [ $cost, @points ];
    } 0 .. $self->R - 1;
    my $tour = reduce { $a->[0] < $b->[0] ? $a : $b } @tours;
    return @$tour;
}

=head2 $ts->populate_partial_tours

Populates internal data structure C<cost($i,$j)> containing optimal partial
tour costs and paths.

=cut

sub populate_partial_tours {
    my $self = shift;

    # Set cost(0,1) is equal to delta(0,1).  This correctness of this cost
    # follows from the problem definition, and doing this simplifies future
    # loop ranges. (I have mixed feelings about this step; it would be nice if
    # this was handled by a more subtle choice of loop indices.)
    $self->tour_cost(0, 1, $self->delta(0,1) );
    $self->tour_points(0, 1, 0, 1);

    # find optimal tours for all points 2, 3, ... up to R
    foreach my $k (2 .. $self->R) {

        # for each point "i" to the left of "k", find (and save) the optimal
        # partial bitonic tour from "i" to "k".
        foreach my $i (0 .. $k - 1) {
            my ($cost, @points) = $self->optimal_partial_tour($i,$k);
            $self->tour_cost($i, $k, $cost);
            $self->tour_points($i, $k, @points);
        }
    }
}

=head2 $ts->optimal_partial_tour($i,$j)

Determines the optimal partial tour from point C<$i> to point C<$j>, based on
the values of previously calculated optimal tours.

Two cases, ($i < $j - 1) and ($i = $j - 1)

    A[i,j] = A[i,j-1] + d(j-1,j)                 if j > i+1
    A[i,j] = min[ k < i ] { A[k,i] + d(k,j) }    if j = i+1

Example:

    # determine the cost of 
    my $cost = $ts->optimal_cost(20,25);

=cut

    # the inputs, but this stricture simplifies things)
    croak "ERROR: bad call, optimal_partial_tour(@_)" unless $i < $j;

    # if $i and $j are adjacent, many valid bitonic tours (i => x => j) are
    # possible; choose the shortest one.

    # is possible.
    return $self->_optimal_partial_tour_nonadjacent($i, $j) if $i + 1 < $j;

    croak "ERROR: bad call, optimal_partial_tour(@_)";
}

    my @tours = map {
        my $x = $_;
        my $cost = $self->tour_cost($x,$i) + $self->delta($x,$j);
        my @path = reverse($j, $self->tour_points($x, $i) );
        [ $cost, @path ];
    } 0 .. $i - 1;
    my $min_tour = reduce { $a->[0] < $b->[0] ? $a : $b } @tours;
